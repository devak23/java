/* FROM Java Coding Problems - Anghel Leonard:
 * We are pretty familiar with ASCII characters. We have unprintable control codes between 0-31, printable characters
 * between 32-127, and extended ASCII codes between 128-255. But what about Unicode characters? Consider this section
 * for each problem that requires that we manipulate Unicode characters.
 * So, in a nutshell, early Unicode versions contained characters with values less than 65,535 (0xFFFF). Java represents
 *  these characters using the 16-bit char data type. Calling charAt(i) works as expected as long as i doesn't exceed
 * 65,535. But over time, Unicode has added more characters and the maximum value has reached 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF).
 * These characters don't fit into 16 bits, and so 32-bit values (known as code points) were considered for the UTF-32
 * encoding scheme.
 *
 * Unfortunately, Java doesn't support UTF-32! Nevertheless, Unicode has come up with a solution for still using 16 bits
 * to represent these characters. This solution implies the following:
 *
 * 16-bit high surrogates: 1,024 values (U+D800 to U+DBFF)
 * 16-bit low surrogates: 1,024 values (U+DC00 to U+DFFF)
 *
 * Now, a high surrogate followed by a low surrogate defines what is known as a surrogate pair. Surrogate pairs are used
 * to represent values between 65,536 (0x10000) and 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF). So, certain characters, known as Unicode
 * supplementary characters, are represented as Unicode surrogate pairs (a one-character (symbol) fits in the space of
 * a pair of characters) that are merged into a single code point. Java takes advantage of this representation and
 * exposes it via a suite of methods such as codePointAt(), codePoints(), codePointCount(), and offsetByCodePoints()
 * (take a look at the Java documentation for details). Calling codePointAt() instead of charAt(), codePoints() instead
 * of chars(), and so on helps us to write solutions that cover ASCII and Unicode characters as well.
 *
 * For example, the well-known two hearts symbol is a Unicode surrogate pair that can be represented as a char[]
 * containing two values: \uD83D and \uDC95. The code point of this symbol is 128149.
 * - To obtain a String object from this code point, call String str = String.valueOf(Character.toChars(128149)).
 * - Counting the code points in str can be done by calling str.codePointCount(0, str.length()), which returns 1 even
 * if the str length is 2.
 * - Calling str.codePointAt(0) returns 128149.
 * - Calling str.codePointAt(1) returns 56469.
 * - Calling Character.toChars(128149) returns 2 since two characters are needed to represent this code point being a
 * Unicode surrogate pair.
 * For ASCII and Unicode 16- bit characters, it will return 1.
