# Java Programs
Just a collection of java programs for a quick mental note.
Consists of:
1. Design Patterns
- Adapter, Builder, Command, NullObject, Observer, Singleton, Strategy, Visitor
2. Custom ClassLoader
3. Concurrency
- Producer consumer implementation with PriorityBlockingQueue
- ReadWriteLock implementation using synchronized keyword
- BoundedBuffer (an implementation of ArrayBlockingQueue)
- ReentrantReadWriteLock (a simple implementation)
- Futures and Callables (a simple word search example)
- Synchronization gotcha (Effective Java)
- Futures using ExecutorService
- Added a sample program that uses SynchronousQueue for Producer Consumer problem
4. NIO examples
- WordCount
- Direct and NonDirect ByteBuffer file read
- MemoryMappedFile example
