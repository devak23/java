# Decorator Pattern

In this example, I've attempted to use the following:

- Singleton using enum for decorator, PizzaFactory, Condiments, PizzaTypes
- Factory pattern for PizzaFactory
- NullObject pattern
- Abstract base class Pizza with implementation of child classes
- Instantiation of the Pizza child classes using reflection
