    // The following formula helps us to determine the optimal size of the pool:
    // Number of threads = Number of CPUs * Target CPU utilization * (1 + W/C)
    // where W = Wait Time
    // and C = Compute Time
    // As a rule of thumb, for compute-intensive tasks (usually small tasks), it can be a good idea to benchmark the thread pool
    // with the number of threads equal with to number of processors or number of processors + 1 (to prevent potential pauses).
    // For time-consuming and blocking tasks (for example, I/O), a larger pool is better since threads will not be available for
    // scheduling at a high rate. Also, pay attention to interferences with other pools (for example, database connections pools,
    // and socket connection pools).
