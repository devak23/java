Just a collection of java programs for a quick mental note.
Consists of:
1. Design Patterns
2. Custom ClassLoader
3. Concurrency
   a. Producer consumer implementation with PriorityBlockingQueue
   b. ReadWriteLock implementation using synchronized keyword
   c. BoundedBuffer (an implementation of ArrayBlockingQueue)
   d. ReentrantReadWriteLock (...Work in Progress)
