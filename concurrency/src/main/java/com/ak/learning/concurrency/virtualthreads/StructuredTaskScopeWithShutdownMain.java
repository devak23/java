// thread (a single Subtask). Basically, we fetched the tester with ID 1 from our server (we had to wait until this one
// was available). In this program, letâ€™s assume that we still need a single tester, but not mandatorily the one with
// ID 1. This time, it could be any of IDs 1, 2, or 3. We simply take the first one that is available from these three,
// and we cancel the other two requests.

// You just create the scope, fork your subtasks, call join(), and collect the result. So the scope is really business
// focused. A task that completes exceptionally under the ShutdownOnSuccess umbrella will never be chosen to produce a
// result. However, if all tasks complete exceptionally, then we will get an ExecutionException that wraps the exception
// (i.e., the cause) of the first completed task.
