# Java Programs
Just a collection of java programs for a quick mental note.
Consists of:
1. Design Patterns
2. Custom ClassLoader
3. Concurrency
   a. Producer consumer implementation with PriorityBlockingQueue
   b. ReadWriteLock implementation using synchronized keyword
   c. BoundedBuffer (an implementation of ArrayBlockingQueue)
   d. ReentrantReadWriteLock (a simple implementation)
   e. Futures and Callables (a simple word search example)
   f. Synchronization gotcha (Effective Java)
